# Go Motif Pooling

**Graph Neural Networks with Motif-Based Pooling for Go Game Analysis**

An implementation of Graph Neural Networks with motif-based pooling for Go game position analysis. A dual-stream pooling architecture that utilizes Go-specific patterns (bamboo joints, tiger's mouth, eyes, empty triangles) to enhance graph coarsening.

- **Motif-Enhanced Graphs**: Augments spatial lattice with pattern connectivity
- **Dual-Stream Pooling**: Combines selection-based and clustering-based graph coarsening
- **Pattern Detection**: Automated recognition of 8 Go tactical patterns using 2D convolutions
